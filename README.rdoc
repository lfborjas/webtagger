= webtagger

Webtagger is a simple ruby gem that uses the web intelligence to extract important terms in texts, suitable for tagging them, finding the main subject or automatically building queries.

* {Yahoo term extraction}[http://developer.yahoo.com/search/content/V1/termExtraction.html]
* {Tag-the-net}[http://tagthe.net] (Needs and API key!)
* {Alchemy API}[http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/keyword/textc.html] (Needs an API key!)

And it's written to support any API in the future. 

==Installation
    gem install webtagger

==Usage

Besides that pickle, the standard usage is really simple:
    require 'webtagger'
    text = "Hi, I'm text"
    #you simply call the appropriate method:
    tags = WebTagger.tag_with_tagthe(text)
    #some APIs might need an api key, pass that as the second parameter
    tags = WebTagger.tag_with_yahoo(text, "YOUR-API-KEY")
    

WebTagger uses caching so rest assured you won't be throttled by the API providers.

If something funny happens (a 4XX or 5XX response is returned), nil will be returned.
   
== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
